#### Timestamps Configuration in config.json

The `timestamps` section in the `config.json` file is used to control how time-related information is displayed in your
Discord Rich Presence.

##### Timestamp Modes

- **Elapsed**:
    - `mode`: When set to 'elapsed', the timestamp displays the duration since the `startTimestamp`. It effectively
      shows how much time has passed since a specific starting point.

- **Remaining**:
    - `mode`: If set to 'remaining', the timestamp counts down from the `endTimestamp`. This mode is used to indicate
      how much time is left until a specified ending point.

##### Additional Timestamp Settings

- `autoStart`: Set this to true if you want the start timestamp to automatically be set to the current time.
- `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp`: These are the start and end points for your timer, set in Unix time format.
- `show`: Determines whether the timestamp is displayed in your Discord presence (true/false).

#### Finding Your Discord Application's Client ID

To connect your application with Discord, you'll need your unique `clientId`. Here's how to find it:

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select your application or create a new one if you haven't already.
3. On the application's overview page, you will find the `clientId` in the OAuth2 section.
4. Click the copy button next to the `clientId` to copy it to your clipboard.

Once you have your `clientId`, insert it into the `clientId` field in your `config.json` file.
